# Voting System

This is a simple Python program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

## How it works

1. The program asks the user to enter their age.
2. It checks if the entered age is 18 or above.
3. If the age is 18 or more, it prints that the user is eligible to vote.
4. Otherwise, it prints that the user is not eligible to vote.

## Code

```python
print("voting system")
age2 = int(input("enter your age"))
if age2 >= 18:
    print("you are eligibilty for vote")
else:
    print("you are not eligibilty for vote")
